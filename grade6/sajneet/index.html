The catchphrase associated with the commercials was "Avoid the Noid." The Noid was discontinued after Kenneth Lamar Noid, believing the mascot to be an imitation of him, held two Domino's employees hostage in Chamblee, Georgia.[79] The employees escaped while Noid ate a pizza he had ordered.[80] Noid was eventually diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and acquitted due to insanity, and later committed suicide.[81][82] The Noid was briefly brought back for a week in 2011 in an arcade-style game on the Domino's Facebook page. The person with the top score received a coupon for a free pizza.[83] cut down development time by providing you with a flexible website editor with a drag and drop interface.

It is the world's second-largest restaurant chain<br>KFC was founded by Colonel Harland Sanders, an entrepreneur who began selling fried chicken from his roadside restaurant in Corbin, Kentucky, during the Great Depression. Sanders identified the potential of the restaurant franchising concept, and the first "Kentucky Fried Chicken" franchise opened in Utah in 1952. KFC popularized chicken in the fast food industry, diversifying the market by challenging the established dominance of the hamburger. By branding himself as "Colonel Sanders", Harland became a prominent figure of American cultural history, and his image remains widely used in KFC advertising to this day.&nbsp;<br></p>

In this regard, about a third of its outlets, operated by several of its franchisees, have been sold to a newly formed entity—Sapphire Foods India Pvt. Ltd.</p>
